is an acronym for recency, frequency, and monetary value.**\n","\n","* Recency: How recently a customer has made a purchase\n","* Frequency: How often a customer makes a purchase\n","* Monetary Value: How much money a customer spends on purchases\n","\n","RFM analysis numerically ranks a customer in each of these three categories, generally on a scale of 1 to 5 (the higher the number, the better the result). The \"best\" customer would receive a top score in every category.\n","\n","**Recency**\n","* The more recently a customer has made a purchase with a company, the more likely they will continue to keep the business and brand in mind for subsequent purchases. Compared with customers who have not bought from the business in months or even longer periods, the likelihood of engaging in future transactions with recent customers is arguably higher.\n","* Such information can be used to get recent customers to revisit the business and spend more. In an effort not to overlook lapsed customers, marketing efforts might be made to remind them that it's been a while since their last transaction, while offering them an incentive to resume buying.\n","\n","\n","**Frequency**\n","* The frequency of a customer’s transactions may be affected by factors such as the type of product, the price point for the purchase, and the need for replenishment or replacement. If the purchase cycle can be predicted — for example when a customer needs to buy more groceries — marketing efforts may be directed towards reminding them to visit the business when staple items run low.\n","\n","\n","**Monetary Value**\n","* Monetary value stems from how much the customer spends. A natural inclination is to put more emphasis on encouraging customers who spend the most money to continue to do so. While this can produce a better return on investment in marketing and customer service, it also runs the risk of alienating customers who have been consistent but may not spend as much with each transaction.\n","\n","Reference:\n","https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rfm-recency-frequency-monetary-value.asp"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":25,"id":"0c039578","metadata":{"execution":{"iopub.execute_input":"2022-05-26T08:19:46.359998Z","iopub.status.busy":"2022-05-26T08:19:46.359436Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-05-26T08:19:46.363483Z","shell.execute_reply":"2022-05-26T08:19:46.362614Z"},"papermill":{"duration":0.069172,"end_time":"2022-05-26T08:19:46.365426","exception":false,"start_time":"2022-05-26T08:19:46.296254","status":"completed"},"tags":[]},"outputs":[],"source":["#We
